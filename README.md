# word-counter
A small JavaScript project that counts words as they are typed in the text area field. 

The code to ignore the 'spacebar' to count as a word I split the value to make it an array and then I implented this if-statement code:
 - if ( words[i] != "" ) {
            wordCount += 1
        }
